			<p class = "lead">Data science is more than just a buzzword. It is a rapidly growing multidisciplinary field that
                offers opportunities and possibilities for advancement over a vast range of industries. In the
                last few years the University of Western Australia (UWA) has opened its doors to students
                interested in this exciting field of study by establishing its Data Science program.</p>
			<p class = "lead">The founding members of the Data Science Club of UWA (DSC) team, Sam Hobson, May-Lyn Hu 
                and Cesar Gonzalez, discovered during their studies that because data science was
                a relatively new addition to UWAâ€™s course offerings there was no unique space for students
                like themselves to share their passion for this new discipline. A combination of statistics and
                computer science studies, no other student club existed that focused on data science or
                represented data science students. With the aim of developing a space for like-minded
                students to connect with one other and industry professionals through their interest in data
                and the technological advancements possible through this ever-evolving field, the Data
                Science Club of UWA was formed in February 2019, before becoming SOC affiliated in
                March 2019.</p>
